              <h3>Running</h3>
              <p>I like to get out on the trail in my neighborhood for a run at least three times a week. I usually go for a four-mile run everytime. Sometimes, on the weekend I would go longer if the time allowed.</p>

              <h3>Gardening/Landscaping</h3>
              <p>Homeownership is fun but it can be tough at times. Especially with my work and school schedules, it has never been easy to keep the landscaping in its best shape. However, I try my best to spend some time and take care of the landscaping, making sure it<span>'</span>s always clean and neat. I also enjoy growing some vegetables and herbs in my backyards. It is fun to harvest some fresh and organic tomatoes or basils from my own garden to make a meal.</p>

            <p>I love cooking and trying new recipes all the time. I am Vietnamese American so of course I can make the best Pho, Spring rolls, Banh Mi,... and many other dishes. Korean and Japanese cuisines are what i often try to cook too. They turned out good most of the time.</p>

              <h3>Die Engineer</h3>
              <p>A die engineer works on the entire life cycle of die for a company. My responsibilities are establishing the development process and the manufacturing parameters for die components, troubleshooting quality issues, making corrective measures, guiding designers to create castings, documenting production cost, and maintaining the casting equipment.

              <p>Using CAD software to create plastic molds for manufacturing processes such as injection molding.  The position entails designing molds using computer design software such as AutoCAD, Unigraphics, Pro-Engineer (Pro-E), and Solidworks.  Once the molds are created the designer should visit the manufacturing facilities to participate in the mold trials to ensure they produce parts and products as designed.  I also have experience with understanding the intricacies of making molds for plastics and have expert skills on how the injection molding process works.</p>
